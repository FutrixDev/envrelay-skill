# Install EnvRelay: the envrelay binary and the EnvRelay skill, in one command.
#
# Every release carries this file as install.sh, and the one-line command,
#   curl -fsSL https://envrelay.com/install.sh | sh
# runs the latest release's copy, which the site redirects to. The same file
# ships inside the skill, so an agent that has the skill but not the binary
# runs `sh <skill dir>/install.sh --bin-only` once the user says yes.
# In order, it:
#
#   1. downloads SHA256SUMS, the envrelay binary for this machine and the skill
#      from one release, and refuses any file whose checksum does not match;
#   2. puts envrelay in ~/.local/bin (or --bin-dir), replacing it atomically;
#   3. puts the skill in ~/.agents/skills/envrelay, which Codex, Cursor, Gemini
#      CLI, OpenCode, Copilot and most other agents read, and symlinks it into
#      ~/.claude/skills (and ~/.kiro/skills, ~/.cline/skills when present);
#   4. adds the bin directory to PATH in your shell's rc file if it is missing;
#   5. checks for python3 3.9+ and git, which the skill's scripts use.
#
# It never uses sudo, never touches a backup, and never replaces a skill
# directory or link it did not create. Why it exists, and why it is not one of
# the skill's scripts: docs/decisions/024-one-command-install.md.
#
# Everything is a function until the last line, so a download cut off halfway
# runs nothing.

Install EnvRelay: the envrelay binary and the EnvRelay skill for coding agents.

  sh install.sh [OPTIONS]

Every release carries this file as install.sh; envrelay.com redirects to the
latest release's copy. Through the one-line command, options go after sh -s --:

  curl -fsSL https://envrelay.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run

Options:
  --version X.Y.Z    install that release instead of the latest one
  --bin-dir DIR      where envrelay goes (default ~/.local/bin, or $ENVRELAY_BIN_DIR)
  --bin-only         install the binary only, not the skill
  --no-modify-path   never edit a shell rc file
  --dry-run          say what would happen; download and change nothing
  --uninstall        remove what this installer put in place (never a backup)
  -h, --help         show this help

Run from inside an installed skill (sh <skill dir>/install.sh), it installs the
release that matches that skill's version rather than the latest one.
ENVRELAY_DOWNLOAD_URL replaces the GitHub release URL with a mirror, or with a
local directory holding the release assets.
